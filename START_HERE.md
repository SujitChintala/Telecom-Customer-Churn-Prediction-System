## üöÄ STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE

### ‚ö° Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Open PowerShell in this directory**
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\HI\Documents\GitHub\Logistic_Regression_Project"
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **Note:** If you skipped the package installation earlier, run it now. It will take 2-3 minutes.

3. **Train the model**
   ```powershell
   python train.py
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning (this takes 2-3 minutes)
   - Train the logistic regression model
   - Evaluate and save the model
   - Generate visualization plots
   
   **You'll see:** Progress updates and final performance metrics

4. **Run the web application**
   ```powershell
   python app.py
   ```
   
   **You'll see:** "Application running at: http://localhost:5000"

5. **Open your browser**
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`
   - You'll see a beautiful form for churn prediction!

6. **Test the application**
   - Fill in some customer details (use examples below)
   - Click "Predict Churn"
   - See the results with probabilities and recommendations!
